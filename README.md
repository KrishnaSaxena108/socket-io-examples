# Socket.io Examples
*Updated: 09/30/2025*

This will be a repository of examples for using the socket.io library.  

Ref: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/index.htm

These examples can be used to implement socket.io into an application.  This is a very basic example of socket.io in a Node.js application.  
Refer to the abover url for more info and to expand on this implementation.  

Socket.io can provide real-time updates to client browser. 

## Usage
I'm using this repo as an example/testing playground for real-time data that I use on other applications.
